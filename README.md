[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/dolfyn-xarray/badge/?version=latest)](https://dolfyn-xarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

DOLfYN is the Doppler Oceanography Library for pYthoN.

It is designed to read and work with Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter
(ADV) and Acoustic Doppler Profiler (ADP/ADCP) data. DOLfYN includes
libraries for reading binary Nortek(tm) and Teledyne RDI(tm) data
files.
* Read in binary data files from acoustic Doppler instruments:
* Clean data
* Rotate vector data through coordinate systems (i.e. beam - instrument - Earth frames of reference)
* Motion correction for buoy-mounted ADV velocity measurements (via onboard IMU data)
* Bin/ensemble averaging
* Calculate turbulence statistics
